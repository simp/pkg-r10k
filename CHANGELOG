* Mon Apr 01 2019 Jeanne Greulich <jeanne.greulich@onyxpoint.com> - 3.1.1
- Updated source versions to use r10k 3.1.1 and updated
  dependency gems where possible.  Latest puppet_forge
  gem relies on faraday ~> 0.9.0 so that gem
  cannot be updated until next release of puppet_forge gem.
- Remove puppet 4 support.
- Updated the version of simp-rake-helpers in Gemfile
  because earlier version has r10k dependency set to ~> 2.2.
- Updated release for all dependencies so they would all be reinstalled
  in the new simp-r10k directory.  Gem dependencies were being installed 
  in r10k-<version> directory.  If r10k was
  updated it create a new r10k-<version> directory but if dependencies had
  not been updated they were not reinstalled in new directory. To fix this
  the version number was removed off the gem sub-directory. The release
  versions had to be updated this one time to force reinstall in the new
  versionless directory.
- Add fixtures file so FIPS tests will pass.
- updated Gemfile for simp-beaker-helpers to include new functions used in
  testing
