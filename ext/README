WARNING

Be careful when upgrading, several of the Gemfiles needed to be changed because
they made assumptions about the gem directories being in a Git repo.

The only items that need to be changed are the 'files' statements in some of
the gemspec files.

If there are GPG signing keys listed, you may also need to update those.
